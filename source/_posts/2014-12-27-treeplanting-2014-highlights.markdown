It was my second year of planting out in BC. Mostly around kamloops. Feeling fairly nostalgic about it right now although if I 
end up back there (as if it's even a question) I'm probably going to hate most of it. 

Here's the gang. Left to right: Simon, Kiddo, Sara, Kent.

Tosh looking like a wolf hanging out with me as I load up my bags with trees.

Cool panorama of, I believe, the last block we planted for the year.
