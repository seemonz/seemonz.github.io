<h1>Climbing in Bishop</h1>

Went on a nine day climbing trip down to Bishop California with a bunch of climbing folk from 
Winnipeg. 

I've never been specifically on a bouldering trip but turns out that just climbing with pads
is pretty rad.

On the way back we took slight detour and checked out the Moab, UT area.

We got there at 3am and slept under the stairs. I woke up first.

Oh hey look at that boulder with the v15 and v16.

I also ran into Jesus out in the desert.

Arches National Park right outside of moab. Probably the coolest place I've been to so far.

We scrambled along some of those rock ridges.
