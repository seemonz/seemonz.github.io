Most of my evenings are spent on these fucking ridiculous internet type tangents. 

I start watching something funny and most likely it's of a standup comedian. I'll then wikipedia
this individual, because I **need ** to know how they became successful and exactly how many failed 
marriages they've had, usually much more interesting if the person is an actor.
After I've fully absorbed their life via wiki for some reason I go off on one of those link it back 
to the jesus wikipedia page games. 

Anyways, I'm stuck on Jim Gaffigan at the moment and his standup specials are great but he is exceptionally 
good on letterman and conan latenight shows. 

But basically I started watching one of his specials and end up hours later looking at 
a professional photographers webpage that Gaffigan hired for one of his special cover shots.
After watching like 4 hours of radio show interviews, small bits from late night tv, parts of other standup
and his small roles in television. 

Mostly I just wish I was spending my time on something a little more productive or at the very least a book.

Oh well.
