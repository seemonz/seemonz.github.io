Basically my attempt at learning how to build something of a site.
It's using [octopress] (http://octopress.org/), a static site generator built on ruby and jekyll.
I managed to get most stuff working with no prior experience using the terminal or coding.
Not too bad I feel like.
Gonna have to come back to this at some point and fix it up, now that I'm abit more competent.
