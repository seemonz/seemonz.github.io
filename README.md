So I wanted to build a [website.] (http://seemonz.github.io)

Basically my attempt at learning how to build something of a site.

It's using [octopress] (http://octopress.org/), a static site generator built on ruby and jekyll.
I managed to get most stuff working with no prior experience using the terminal or coding.
Not too bad I feel like.
